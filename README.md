## Planet War
Made using React and Javascript, Planet War is a Real Time Strategy game that focuses on using your units to capture planets -- which then go on to produce more units for your cause. When yours and an enemy unit meet, they destroy each other 1:1 until only one side remains. Neutral planets cap out at 10 units, and your Red enemy will be attacking you at every turn. The first colored player to eliminate the other wins.

Planet formations are randomly generated for each map, so the game can be replayed again and again.
